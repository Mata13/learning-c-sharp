# <span style="color:#FFD700"> BODY MASS INDEX calculator </span>

This small project is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator.

Initially, the calculator works in the terminal. However, I plan to develop a graphical interfase version using Visual Studio on Windows 11. As of now, the calculator operates in the terminal since I am currently using Manjaro.

<span style="color:#AFEEEE"> To use the calculator, you need to input your weight in kilograms (kg) and your height in meters (m). </span>
