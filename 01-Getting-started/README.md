# <span style="color:#00FFFF"> Learning C# Repository. </span>

This is a space where I will be sharing my progress and projects as I learn and practice the C# programming language.

This file contains a short description of the meaning of variables in C#, the types of variables, and how you should declare them.

## <span style="color:#FFE4B5"> Variables </span>

Variables are used to store and manipulate data. They hold values of different types, such as numbers, text, or boolean (true/false) values. When declaring a variable, you specify its type and give it a name.

1. <span style="color:#AFEEEE"> To declare a variable, you use the syntax: 'type variableName;'. For example: </span>

```
int age;
string name;
bool isStudent;
```

2. <span style="color:#AFEEEE"> You can also initialize a variable at the time of declaration by assigning it a value: </span>

```
int age = 26;
string name = "John";
bool isStudent = true;
```

3. <span style="color:#AFEEEE"> You can assing a new value to an existing variable using the assignament operator '=': </span>

```
age = 28;
name = "Marc";
isStudent = false;
```

4. <span style="color:#AFEEEE"> C# has several built-in data types, including: </span>

- 'int': Integers values (e.g., 5, -10, 100).
- 'double': Double-precision floating-point values (e.g., 3.14, -0.5, 2.0).
- 'string': Text values (e.g., "Hello", "World").
- 'bool': Booleans values ('true' or 'false').
- And many more.
