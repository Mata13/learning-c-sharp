# <span style="color:#00FFFF"> Learning C# Repository. </span>

This is a space where I will be sharing my progress and projects as I learn and practice the C# programming language.

I am currently using Manjaro and the programs works in the terminal.

I will be starting with the basics of C#, including variables, arrays, conditionals, loops and many more.
